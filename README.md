# init

This first project, `init`, will give you the opportunity to discover system and network
basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of
scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

1. Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine without displaying any detail
for these interfaces. Only the list of names.

    - `ifconfig -a | sed 's/[ \t].*//;/^$/d'`
    
    - `ifconfig -a | sed 's/[ \t].*//;/^\(lo\|\)$/d'`

2. Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
    
    (a) Identify broadcast address
        - 172.28.159.255
        - `ifconfig [device name, in this case eth0] | grep broadcast | awk '{print $6}'`
    
    (b) Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet

3. Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card
    
    - `ifconfig en1 | awk '/ether/{print $2}' `
    
    - I don't have a wifi card
    
    - But `en1` should be the name of the wifi card in `ifconfig`

4. Identify the default gateway in the routing table
    
    - `route`

5. Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to any url

    - `nslookup [url]`
       
       - `nslookup` - query Internet name servers interactively  
    
    - `dig [url]`
        - Just the IP address: `dig slash16.org | grep SERVER | awk '{print $3}' | awk -F '[()]' '{print $2}'`
            
            - `dig` is used to query DNS for slash16.org
            
            - The IP address i located in the server part
            
            - `awk -F '[()]' '{print $2}'` will extract values between brackets '()'
            
            - The `-F` fs option defines the input field separator to be the regular expression fs

6. Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server youâ€™re using

    - `/run/resolvconf/resolv.conf`

7. Query an external DNS server on the slash16.org domain name (ie. : google 8.8.8.8)
    
    - `dig [url]` 
    - `nslookup [url]`
