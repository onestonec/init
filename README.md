# init

This first project, `init`, will give you the opportunity to discover system and network
basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of
scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.

It was an interesting project mostly focusing on scripting and basics of linux commands in system administration domain

Have a lot more to work on in the scripting side
