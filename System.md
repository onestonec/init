# System

1. In what file can you find the installed version of your Debian?

    - `../usr/lib/os-release`
    
    - I am using WSL with Ubuntu, so maybe different on macOS

2. What command can you use to rename your system?

    - `sudo hostname new`

3. What file has to be modified to make it permanent?
    
    -  `/etc/hostname`

4. What command gives you the time since your system was last booted?
    
    -  `who -b` (should work, but has no output on my machine)
    
    - `uptime -s`
